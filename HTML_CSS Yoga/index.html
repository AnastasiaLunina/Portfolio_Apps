      <h3 class="info_types_item">Vinyasa yoga</h3>
      <p class="info_types_par">Vinyasa yoga is the often considered the most athletic yoga style. Vinyasa was adapted from ashtanga yoga in the 1980s. Many types of yoga can also be considered vinyasa flows such as ashtanga, power yoga, and prana.</p>
      <h3 class="info_types_item">How to practice:</h3>
      <p class="info_types_par">In vinyasa classes, the movement is coordinated with your breath and movement to flow from one pose to another. Vinyasa styles can vary depending on the teacher, and there can be many types of poses in different sequences. I personally teach an alignment-based style of vinyasa and choreograph new flows every time, but I also like to hold some of the poses a bit longer after warming up</p>

      <h3 class="info_types_item">Hatha yoga</h3>
      <p class="info_types_par">The Sanskrit term "hatha" is an umbrella term for all physical postures of yoga. In the West, hatha yoga simply refers to all the other styles of yoga (ashtanga, Iyengar, etc.) that are grounded in a physical practice. However, there are other branches of yoga such as kriya, raja, and karma yoga that are separate from the physical-based yoga practice. The physical-based yoga is the most popular and has numerous styles.</p>
      <h3 class="info_types_item">How to practice:</h3>
      <p class="info_types_par">Hatha yoga classes are best for beginners since they are usually paced slower than other yoga styles. Hatha classes today are a classic approach to breathing and exercises. If you are brand-new to yoga, hatha yoga is a great entry point to the practice.</p>

      <h3 class="info_types_item">How to practice:</h3>
      <p class="info_types_par">These classes really work your core and breathing with fast-moving, invigorating postures and breath exercises. These classes are pretty intense and can involve chanting, mantra, and meditation</p>

      <p class="info_types_par">Hot yoga is a form of yoga as exercise performed under hot and humid conditions, usually set to 105 degrees and 40% humidity, resulting in considerable sweating. Some hot yoga practices seek to replicate the heat and humidity of India, where yoga originated. Bikram Choudhury has suggested that the heated environment of Bikram Yoga helps to prepare the body for movement and to "remove impurities".</p>
      <h3 class="info_types_item">How to practice:</h3>
      <p class="info_types_par">The sequence includes a series of 26 basic postures, with each one performed twice. Many of these poses are focused on proper alignment. If you're interested in yoga with the heat turned up, look for studios that offer hot yoga classes.</p>

            Yoga improves strength, balance and flexibility.
            Slow movements and deep breathing increase blood flow and warm up muscles, while holding a pose can build strength.

            <p class="container_why_list_par">Balance on one foot, while holding the other foot to your calf or above the knee (but never on the knee) at a right angle. Try to focus on one spot in front of you, while you balance for one minute.</p>

            Yoga helps with back pain relief.
            Yoga is as good as basic stretching for easing pain and improving mobility in people with lower back pain. The American College of Physicians recommends yoga as a first-line treatment for chronic low back pain.

            <p class="container_why_list_par">Get on all fours, placing your palms underneath your shoulders and your knees underneath your hips. First, inhale, as you let your stomach drop down toward the floor. Then, exhale, as you draw your navel toward your spine, arching your spine like a cat stretching.

            <p class="container_why_list_par">Lie down with your limbs gently stretched out, away from the body, with your palms facing up. Try to clear your mind while breathing deeply. You can hold this pose for 5 to 15 minutes

Integrative and holistic mind-body practices such as yoga and mindfulness meditation have become increasingly popular and beneficial as well when it comes to psychological and physical health issues. In fact, yoga and meditation are considered stress reduction techniques that can influence how we relate to mental and physical health issues, ultimately leading to less suffering and attachment to life outcomes.
         </li>
         <li class="container_why_list_element">Yoga is a holistic and mindful practice that includes physical movements (asana), breathing (pranayama), meditation (dhyana) and relaxation (savasana). The practice cultivates mind-body awareness, promotes physical movement, and creates intimacy with one's internal landscape (e.g., emotions, thoughts, physical sensations). Yoga can also be self-soothing, affecting the stress response system by quieting down the nervous system. Through its impact on the stress response system, yoga can help to decrease physiological arousal, for example lowering blood pressure and heart rate, a benefit for those who tend to feel wound up, on edge, and restless.

         <h3 class="container_why_list_heading">The initial list of what you will need:</h3>
         <li class="container_why_list_element">A yoga mat:
            this needs to be stretchy, comfortable but also reasonably sticky, so you don’t slip while stretching (if you sweat more, opt for an open-cell yoga mat);
         </li>
         <li class="container_why_list_element">A yoga mat bag:
            for carrying your mat around without it losing shape;
         </li>
         <li class="container_why_list_element">A water bottle:
            (you will get thirsty during your sequence and it’s essential to stay hydrated), ideal for keeping your supply of fresh water or even lemon water on hand;
         </li>

         <li class="container_why_list_element">A yoga towel: 
            no matter the type of yoga you practice or how peaceful it looks from afar, yoga is still a workout and I can promise you will sweat, especially if you sign up for Hot Yoga;
         </li>
         <li class="container_why_list_element">A yoga strap:
            this is a piece of equipment you will use for wrapping yourself up tightly to deepen the effect of some of the stretches, or you will use it as a prop for certain exercises  to make them a bit more challenging and so on.
         </li>
         <h3 class="container_why_list_heading">Extras to consider:</h3>
         <li class="container_why_list_element">A yoga blanket:
            it’s not mandatory but it will help you relax better towards the end of your training sessions;
         </li>
         <li class="container_why_list_element">A yoga brick or yoga block: 
            especially useful for home practice. Not only does a good block help you achieve a more stable position, but it also provides better comfort and relaxation during the less challenging parts of your yoga workout.</p>
